This folder is for files that are common across all simulations.
They do not depend on time, event, or conditions.  An example is
magnetometer locations, which are constant over many simulations.

Files:

**mags_all.dat**
A comprehensive list of ground mangetometer stations and the geographic
coordinates.  Acts as input for the SWMF to produce virtual stations at
each real station location.  Includes all magnetometers listed on SuperMag,
Image, and others.
