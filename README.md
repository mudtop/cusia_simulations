# cusia_simulations
Space physics simulation input files for CUSIA-related investigations

This repository is for organizing and sharing model input files for
simulations relevant to the **Center for the Unified Study of Interhemispheric
Asymmetries -- CUSIA.**

The folder organization is as follows:

- ideal_simulations: Ideal, simple runs for controlled experiments.
- event_simulations: Inputs for real world event studies
- common_files: Files common for all runs, such as magnetometer positions, etc.

Inside each is a subfolder for each simulation set, and a sub-subfolder for
each model to be run.
